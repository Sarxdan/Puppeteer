(7) By clicking LEFT MOUSE on any room the puppeteer can pick it up and place it down in a new location aslong as it does not disconnect any room from the mace. No puppets can be in the room when it's moved, minons does not hinder the movment but instead simply dies, however SPAWNERS and TRAPS just follow the room.
