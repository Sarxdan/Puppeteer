GIT GUIDELINES FOR THE PUPPETEER PROJECT
* Everyone works on the branch named master unless they are working on a big feature that has the possibility to brick the code.
* When a feature branch is created only the specific feature should be worked on while on that branch to avoid conflicts when merging later.
* Before creating a feature branch consult other team members to determine if it is necessary.
* Feature branches should only be used of absolutely necessary.
* If a merge conflicts happens and you are not sure how to solve it, consult the author of the code or the git lead if necessary.
* Commit often, every time you wrote something that works and write messages that explain what you have done.
* Git pull before you git push
* When we have reached a certain stage in the project e.g. we have an alpha version. 
  A new branch can be created from that commit and saved so that work can continue without fear of not having something show.
